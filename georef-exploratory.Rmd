_**How many specimen records for Mammalia exist on iDigBio and GBIF?**_

- **iDigBio** = `r format(mammalia_idb, big.mark = ",")`
- **GBIF** = `r format(mammalia_gbif, big.mark = ",")`

_**How many of these specimen records are georeferenced already?**_

- **iDigBio** = `r format(mammalia_georef_idb, big.mark = ",")` (`r round(sum(mammalia_georef_idb/mammalia_idb*100), 1)`%)
- **GBIF** = `r format(mammalia_georef_gbif, big.mark = ",")` (`r round(sum(mammalia_georef_gbif/mammalia_gbif*100), 1)`%)

_**Of those specimen records that are not already georeferenced, how many have something in the locality field?**_

- **iDigBio** = `r format(mammalia_locality_idb, big.mark = ",")` (`r round(sum(mammalia_locality_idb/(mammalia_idb-mammalia_georef_idb)*100), 1)`%)

### Scoped by taxonomic family of interest

**Primary taxonomic scope**: Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae

**Secondary taxonomic scope**: Megadermatidae, Rhinopomatidae, Craseonycteridae

**Tertiary taxonomic scope**: Pteropodidae

**Broadest taxonomic scope**: TBD civet and pangolins (Pholidota) taxa

For each family, we want to know:

1. How many specimen records exist on iDigBio and on GBIF?
1. How many of these records are already georeferenced?
1. Of those records that are not already georeferenced, how many have something in the locality field?
1. How many distinct collections are providing these specimen records?
    - Who are the top five data providers based on total number of records?
    - What percentage of records are contributed by these top five?
    - Who are the top five data providers based on number of records needing to be georeferenced?
    - What percentage of records needing to be georeferenced are contributed by these top five?
1. Where are these recordsets being mobilized from? (e.g. the VertNet IPT)
1. What is the geographic scope represented in these records, measured by country of collection?
    - All records
    - Records in need of georeferencing
1. What is the temporal scope represented in these records, measured by year of collection?
    - All records
    - Records in need of georeferencing
1. What is the taxonomic scope represented in these records, measured by distinct species?
    - All records
    - Records in need of georeferencing
1. What kind of ancillary locality information is represented in these records, measured by presence of values in the habitat field?
    - All records
    - Records in need of georeferencing
1. What kind of ancillary locality information is represented in these records, measured by presence of values in the preparations and associatedSequences fields?
    - All records
    - Records in need of georeferencing
